# Project Description

This is a web application built using Next.JS and MongoDB with an admin panel. The admin panel allows the administrator to modify the database within the application through an API.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the development of this project:

Next.js - a React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
MongoDB - a document-based NoSQL database for storing data.
Node.js - a JavaScript runtime used for building server-side applications.

## Functionality

The application provides an API for administrators to access the database and perform the following actions:

GET /api/data - request to retrieve data from the database.
POST /api/data - request to add new data to the database.

## Implementation Challenges

Several challenges were encountered during the development of this project, including:

Setting up MongoDB - the application required the setup of a MongoDB database to facilitate interaction with the application.
Admin Panel Development - the development of the admin panel was necessary to provide efficient data management and ensure security. Development required careful planning and the use of appropriate technologies.

## Conclusion

This project serves as an excellent example of the use of Next.JS and MongoDB in a web application with an admin panel. The application provides efficient and convenient data management using an API, making it interesting for exploration and use in various projects.
